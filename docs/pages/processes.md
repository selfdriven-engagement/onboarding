# Processes

The “selfdriven Progressive Self-Actuation Framework" emphasises the importance of understanding community sustainable processes.

## Framework for Discovering & Designing Sustainable Community Processes

### 1. Discovery Layer – Understand What Exists

	- Mapping Practices
	- Use 5W1H (Why, What, Who, How, When, Where) to document current community practices.
	- Capture informal as well as formal processes.
	- Identify Energy Flows
	- What brings energy (motivation, resources, engagement)?
	- What drains energy (friction, exclusion, waste)?
	- Community Values Alignment
	- Map processes against community values (e.g., fairness, inclusion, transparency).
	- Spot misalignments where processes undermine the intended ethos.

### 2. Design Layer – Create or Adapt

	- Principle-Driven Design
	- Start with design principles: regenerative, inclusive, modular, resilient.
	- Process Archetypes (pick & adapt)
	- Knowledge flow (sharing, documenting, storytelling).
	- Decision-making (consent, deliberation, voting, delegation).
	- Resource flow (funding, labor, time, tokens, reciprocity).
	- Conflict navigation (mediation, reflective listening, restorative loops).
	- Iteration Pathways
	- Define “lightweight pilots” → “scaled process” → “embedded practice.”
	- Build feedback loops at each stage.

### 3. Sustainability Layer – Make It Endure

	- Measure & Reflect
	- Co-define community indicators (e.g., participation diversity, carbon impact, shared ownership).
	- Process Custodians
	- Assign rotating roles or circles that hold/process accountability.
	- Resilience Design
	- Build in redundancy (if one person/group drops out, the process continues).
	- Ensure intergenerational transfer (knowledge persists beyond current members).

### 4. Progressive Self-Actuation Integration
	- Self-Discovery → Self-Design → Self-Sustaining
	- Each layer mirrors your framework: communities progressively move from understanding themselves → shaping themselves → sustaining themselves.
	- Meta-process
	- The process of designing processes is itself iterative and community-owned.
	- Tooling Hooks
	- Can integrate SSI/VCs for trust & credentials.
	- Token flows (CIP-68 assets, octo tokens) for resource tracking.
	- AI assistive loops for feedback, storytelling, and “definition by coding.”

### 5. Practical Tools
	- Community Worksheet Template
	- A fillable guide using 5W1H + energy mapping.
	- Process Charter Template
	- Defines scope, principles, custodians, sustainability measures.
	- Iterative Cycle Canvas
	- Visual loop: Discover → Prototype → Reflect → Embed.
