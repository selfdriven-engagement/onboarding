# Biohub Mallorca (Beyonders Collective)

**A community of regenerators developing a new bioeconomy. A Place Waiting to Bloom.**

Mallorca is alive with regenerative promise—farmers, artists, healers, entrepreneurs—all seeking to live in balance with land and life. But the movement is scattered. There’s no anchor. No common ground.
The Beyonders Mallorca BioHub answers that call. A living campus where soil regeneration, community resilience, and climate
innovation converge.

### The Fire Beneath the Soil
At its core is biochar—carbon-rich soil made from local biomass waste. It locks away CO₂ for centuries. It holds water. It revives microbial life. It boosts food systems. It turns organic waste into economic value.

And in Mallorca, it’s the seed of a regenerative bioeconomy.

We're not just selling soil. We're building a new economic
operating system for regeneration
