# Key Processes - Biohub Mallorca (Beyonders Collective)

**A community of regenerators developing a new bioeconomy. A Place Waiting to Bloom.**

Mallorca is alive with regenerative promise—farmers, artists, healers, entrepreneurs—all seeking to live in balance with land and life. But the movement is scattered. There’s no anchor. No common ground.
The Beyonders Mallorca BioHub answers that call. A living campus where soil regeneration, community resilience, and climate innovation converge.

### The Fire Beneath the Soil
At its core is biochar—carbon-rich soil made from local biomass waste. It locks away CO₂ for centuries. It holds water. It revives microbial life. It boosts food systems. It turns organic waste into economic value.

And in Mallorca, it’s the seed of a regenerative bioeconomy.

We're not just selling soil. We're building a new economic
operating system for regeneration

BioHub Sustainable Process Mapping – Biochar Production & Sales

### Step 1. Feedstock Collection
- Inputs
- Agricultural waste (crop residues, pruning, sawdust, manure)
- Community labor / local partnerships
- Outputs
- Sorted biomass ready for pyrolysis
- Resources
- Collection equipment (trailers, bags, trucks)
- Storage space
- Agreements with farmers / councils
- Outcomes / Value
- Waste diverted from burning/landfill
- Community engagement through resource sharing
- Early education on circular economy

### Step 2. Biochar Production (Pyrolysis)
- Inputs
- Biomass feedstock
- Pyrolysis unit (kiln, retort, or industrial plant)
- Energy (could be partially renewable or from captured syngas)
- Outputs
- Biochar
- Heat energy (co-product)
- Syngas (can be reused)
- Resources
- Technical expertise
- Safety protocols & compliance with environmental standards
- Skilled operators
- Outcomes / Value
- Carbon sequestration (negative emissions)
- Renewable energy for local use
- Local employment / skill building

### Step 3. Processing & Quality Assurance
- Inputs
- Raw biochar
- Testing equipment (pH, surface area, contaminants)
- Standards (e.g., IBI, EBC certification)
- Outputs
- Market-ready biochar product (powder, pellets, blends)
- Certification / proof of quality
- Resources
- Lab services (in-house or partner)
- Packaging materials
- Branding guidelines
- Outcomes / Value
- Trusted, verifiable product
- Differentiation in the carbon/agriculture marketplace

### Step 4. Distribution & Sales
- Inputs
- Packaged biochar
- Marketing materials
- Sales channels (local markets, e-commerce, B2B with farms/industry)
- Outputs
- Sales revenue
- Customer feedback
- Resources
- Online store / cooperative platform
- Logistics partnerships
- Token/payment rails (SDN, local credits, fiat)
- Outcomes / Value
- Sustained income stream for the BioHub
- Local regenerative business ecosystem
- Reinforcement of community self-sufficiency

### Step 5. Community Benefit Loop
- Inputs
- Revenue from sales
- Community governance process (decision-making on reinvestment)
- Outputs
- Funding for education programs, micro-projects, new equipment
- Community tokens / credits circulation
- Resources
- Cooperative governance (circles, charters)
- SSI/VCs to recognize member contributions
- Outcomes / Value
- Reinforcement of self-actuating capacity
- Trust and inclusion through transparent reinvestment
- Expansion into other regenerative practices (compost, energy hubs)
