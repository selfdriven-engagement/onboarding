# Key Processes - Biohub Mallorca (Beyonders Collective)

## BioHub Biochar production & selling process through the Progressive Self-Actuation Framework.

BioHub Sustainable Process Mapping â€“ Biochar Production & Sales

### Step 1. Feedstock Collection
- Inputs
- Agricultural waste (crop residues, pruning, sawdust, manure)
- Community labor / local partnerships
- Outputs
- Sorted biomass ready for pyrolysis
- Resources
- Collection equipment (trailers, bags, trucks)
- Storage space
- Agreements with farmers / councils
- Outcomes / Value
- Waste diverted from burning/landfill
- Community engagement through resource sharing
- Early education on circular economy

### Step 2. Biochar Production (Pyrolysis)
- Inputs
- Biomass feedstock
- Pyrolysis unit (kiln, retort, or industrial plant)
- Energy (could be partially renewable or from captured syngas)
- Outputs
- Biochar
- Heat energy (co-product)
- Syngas (can be reused)
- Resources
- Technical expertise
- Safety protocols & compliance with environmental standards
- Skilled operators
- Outcomes / Value
- Carbon sequestration (negative emissions)
- Renewable energy for local use
- Local employment / skill building

### Step 3. Processing & Quality Assurance
- Inputs
- Raw biochar
- Testing equipment (pH, surface area, contaminants)
- Standards (e.g., IBI, EBC certification)
- Outputs
- Market-ready biochar product (powder, pellets, blends)
- Certification / proof of quality
- Resources
- Lab services (in-house or partner)
- Packaging materials
- Branding guidelines
- Outcomes / Value
- Trusted, verifiable product
- Differentiation in the carbon/agriculture marketplace

### Step 4. Distribution & Sales
- Inputs
- Packaged biochar
- Marketing materials
- Sales channels (local markets, e-commerce, B2B with farms/industry)
- Outputs
- Sales revenue
- Customer feedback
- Resources
- Online store / cooperative platform
- Logistics partnerships
- Token/payment rails (SDN, local credits, fiat)
- Outcomes / Value
- Sustained income stream for the BioHub
- Local regenerative business ecosystem
- Reinforcement of community self-sufficiency

### Step 5. Community Benefit Loop
- Inputs
- Revenue from sales
- Community governance process (decision-making on reinvestment)
- Outputs
- Funding for education programs, micro-projects, new equipment
- Community tokens / credits circulation
- Resources
- Cooperative governance (circles, charters)
- SSI/VCs to recognize member contributions
- Outcomes / Value
- Reinforcement of self-actuating capacity
- Trust and inclusion through transparent reinvestment
- Expansion into other regenerative practices (compost, energy hubs)
