# Production Process - Biohub Mallorca (Beyonders Collective)

**A community of regenerators developing a new bioeconomy. A Place Waiting to Bloom.**

### The Fire Beneath the Soil
At its core is biochar‚Äîcarbon-rich soil made from local biomass waste. It locks away CO‚ÇÇ for centuries. It holds water. It revives microbial life. It boosts food systems. It turns organic waste into economic value.

And in Mallorca, it‚Äôs the seed of a regenerative bioeconomy.

We're not just selling soil. We're building a new economic
operating system for regeneration

## Accountability
*(Mallorca Production ‚Üí EU Market)*


### 1. EU Regulations

| Regulation | Requirement | Status |
|------------|-------------|--------|
| Fertilising Products Regulation (EU) 2019/1009 + Delegated Reg. 2021/2088 | Biochar must meet CMC14 feedstock & processing rules; CE-marked as fertiliser/soil improver | ‚òê |
| Waste Framework Directive (2008/98/EC) | Biochar ceases to be waste if recovery rules & contaminant thresholds are met | ‚òê |
| Organic Farming Regulations (EC 834/2007 + EU 2019/2164) | Biochar permitted as fertiliser/soil conditioner in organic agriculture | ‚òê |
| Carbon Removal Certification Framework (CRCF, 2025‚Üí) | Prepare MRV (Measurement, Reporting, Verification) for carbon credits | ‚òê |

---

## 2. Voluntary Certification

| Standard | Requirement | Status |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| European Biochar Certificate (EBC v9.5) | Pyrolysis at 350‚Äì700¬∞C; <20% feedstock moisture; accredited emissions tests; heavy metal & pH checks | ‚òê |
| World Biochar Certificate (WBC) | Third-party audits, sustainability verification, continuous monitoring | ‚òê |

---

## 3. Spain / Mallorca Context

| Requirement | Responsible Body | Status |
|-------------|------------------|--------|
| Air & emissions permit for pyrolysis kiln | Balearic Islands environmental authority (Conselleria de Medi Ambient) | ‚òê |
| Compliance with Spanish waste & air quality law (transposed EU directives) | MITECO + regional authority | ‚òê |
| Community environmental reporting (annual) | BioHub Custodians + Community Reinvestment Circle | ‚òê |

---

## 4. Verification Metrics

- üìè Moisture content <20% (feedstock)  
- üå° 350‚Äì700¬∞C kiln temperature logs (IBI/EBC)  
- üå´ Emission opacity < local EPA thresholds  
- üß™ Lab tests: pH, heavy metals, carbon content  
- üìä Carbon sequestration: tonnes CO‚ÇÇeq/year, MRV-ready  

---

## 5. Governance & Transparency

- ‚òê Roles defined: Kiln Operator / Safety Officer / QA Lead / Community Circle  
- ‚òê Community ledger updated quarterly (production, emissions, revenue, reinvestment)  
- ‚òê SSI/VCs issued for contributions
