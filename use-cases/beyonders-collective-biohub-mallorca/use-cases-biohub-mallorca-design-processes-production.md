## Accountability
*EU Market*

### 1. EU Regulations

| Regulation | Requirement | Status |
|------------|-------------|--------|
| Fertilising Products Regulation (EU) 2019/1009 + Delegated Reg. 2021/2088 | Biochar must meet CMC14 feedstock & processing rules; CE-marked as fertiliser/soil improver | ‚òê |
| Waste Framework Directive (2008/98/EC) | Biochar ceases to be waste if recovery rules & contaminant thresholds are met | ‚òê |
| Organic Farming Regulations (EC 834/2007 + EU 2019/2164) | Biochar permitted as fertiliser/soil conditioner in organic agriculture | ‚òê |
| Carbon Removal Certification Framework (CRCF, 2025‚Üí) | Prepare MRV (Measurement, Reporting, Verification) for carbon credits | ‚òê |

### 2. Voluntary Certification

| Standard | Requirement | Status |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| European Biochar Certificate (EBC v9.5) | Pyrolysis at 350‚Äì700¬∞C; <20% feedstock moisture; accredited emissions tests; heavy metal & pH checks | ‚òê |
| World Biochar Certificate (WBC) | Third-party audits, sustainability verification, continuous monitoring | ‚òê |

## #3. Spain / Mallorca Context

| Requirement | Responsible Body | Status |
|-------------|------------------|--------|
| Air & emissions permit for pyrolysis kiln | Balearic Islands environmental authority (Conselleria de Medi Ambient) | ‚òê |
| Compliance with Spanish waste & air quality law (transposed EU directives) | MITECO + regional authority | ‚òê |
| Community environmental reporting (annual) | BioHub Custodians + Community Reinvestment Circle | ‚òê |

### 4. Verification Metrics

- üìè Moisture content <20% (feedstock)  
- üå° 350‚Äì700¬∞C kiln temperature logs (IBI/EBC)  
- üå´ Emission opacity < local EPA thresholds  
- üß™ Lab tests: pH, heavy metals, carbon content  
- üìä Carbon sequestration: tonnes CO‚ÇÇeq/year, MRV-ready  


### 5. Governance & Transparency

- ‚òê Roles defined: Kiln Operator / Safety Officer / QA Lead / Community Circle  
- ‚òê Community ledger updated quarterly (production, emissions, revenue, reinvestment)  
- ‚òê SSI/VCs issued for contributions
