# Framework

The “selfdriven Progressive Self-Actuation Framework" emphasises the importance of understanding community contexts to drive effective development. By integrating SkillZeb.io’s universal skill set with the 5W1H analytical method, communities can gain a comprehensive understanding of their unique dynamics, leading to more targeted and impactful initiatives.

**Understanding skillzeb.io**

skillzeb.io offers an open, universal skill set designed to support modern societal needs. This extensive repository of skills is shared under the Creative Commons CC0 Universal (Public Domain Dedication), making it freely accessible for anyone to use and integrate into various projects or communities. The platform also provides a Skill Set Explorer and Template Explorer, enabling users to navigate and implement these skills effectively.&#x20;

**The 5W1H Analytical Method**

The 5W1H method is a structured approach that involves asking six fundamental questions: Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How. This technique is widely applied across diverse fields, including journalism, investigation, project management, and problem-solving. By systematically addressing these questions, communities can gain a comprehensive understanding of specific situations or challenges, leading to more effective solutions.&#x20;

**Applying skillzeb.io and 5W1H in Community Context**

Integrating skillzeb.io with the 5W1H method allows communities to map out their unique skill requirements and address challenges systematically:

**1. Why**\
Understand the rationale behind the need for these skills. Clarify how developing these competencies will benefit the community and contribute to overarching objectives.

**2. What**\
Identify the specific skills needed within the community. Utilize skillzeb.io’s Skill Set Explorer to pinpoint relevant skills that align with community goals.

**3. Who**\
Determine who possesses these skills and who requires them. This involves recognizing existing talent and identifying individuals or groups that would benefit from skill development.

**4. When**\
Establish timelines for skill development initiatives. Decide when training programs should commence and set achievable milestones.

**5. Where**\
Ascertain where these skills are most needed. This could relate to specific projects, departments, or geographical areas within the community.

**6. How**\
Develop strategies for skill acquisition and application. Leverage skillzeb.io’s Template Explorer to find or create templates that facilitate effective learning and integration of new skills.

**Benefits of This Integrated Approach**

• Comprehensive Skill Mapping: By combining skillzeb.io’s resources with the 5W1H method, communities can thoroughly assess their skill landscapes, ensuring that all necessary competencies are identified and addressed.

• Targeted Development: This approach enables the design of focused training programs that cater to specific needs, optimising resource allocation and maximising impact.

• Enhanced Collaboration: A clear understanding of who holds certain skills and who needs them fosters better collaboration and knowledge sharing within the community.

• Strategic Planning: Applying the 5W1H framework aids in creating structured action plans with defined roles, timelines, and objectives, leading to more organised and effective community development efforts.

**In summary,** the fusion of skillzeb.io’s universal skill set with the 5W1H analytical method within the “Community Progressive Actuation” framework empowers communities to gain deep insights into their contexts. This integrated approach facilitates strategic planning and targeted action, driving sustainable and inclusive growth.
